# Solar Panel Fault Detection Using VGG16

## Objective

The accumulation of dust, snow, bird droppings, and other debris on solar panels significantly reduces their efficiency, leading to decreased energy production. Monitoring and cleaning solar panels is crucial for maintaining optimal performance. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach to accurately detect various faults on solar panel surfaces, including dust, snow, bird droppings, physical, and electrical damage.

## Factors Affecting Solar Panel Performance

Several factors can lead to a reduction in power generation from solar panels:

- **Reduced Sunlight**: Less sunlight due to clouds, winter conditions, or high air pollution decreases energy generation.
- **High Temperatures**: Elevated temperatures lower panel efficiency.
- **Dirt and Debris**: Blockage of sunlight by accumulated dirt reduces electricity generation.
- **Degradation**: Solar panels degrade over time, reducing their efficiency.
- **Inverter Failure**: Inverters convert DC to AC power; failure here stops electricity generation.

## Effects of Dirt, Debris, Snow, and Damage

- **Dirt & Debris**: Block sunlight, reducing power output. Regular cleaning is essential.
- **Snow**: Temporarily blocks sunlight; may require manual removal in heavy accumulation.
- **Bird Droppings**: Acidic, potentially damaging the panel surface; immediate cleaning is recommended.
- **Mechanical Damage**: Caused by hail, wind, or other objects; may require repair or replacement.
- **Electrical Damage**: Caused by lightning or surges; damaged panels need repair or replacement.

## Deep Learning & Solar Panel Fault Classification

Deep learning models can classify different types of solar panel faults by recognizing patterns associated with each fault type. They can also localize faults, aiding in precise identification and reducing maintenance time and costs. This project uses the VGG16 deep learning model, known for its accuracy and efficiency in image classification tasks.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of six categories of solar panel images:

- **Clean**: Images of clean solar panels.
- **Dusty**: Images showing dusty panels.
- **Bird-drop**: Panels with bird droppings.
- **Electrical-damage**: Panels with electrical faults.
- **Physical-damage**: Panels with mechanical damage.
- **Snow-covered**: Panels covered in snow.
